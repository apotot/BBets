# Introduction

<!--In this section you explain what you are trying to show.  Where did the data come from?  What is the research or other question you are trying to answer?!-->

 At the first day of class there are 35 students in Math Statistics class and professor Brownlow always proposes this bet to his students "I will wager $2 to your bet of $1 that at least two people in today's class have  the same birthday.  He tells me he has made that bet 1137 times so far. Where do you think his profits are? Discuss this in a markdown document

# Methods

<!--Decide on your methods:  In this section explain the approach you will take to attack the issue --- how will you decide on a likely estimate of professor Brownlow's earnings or losses after 1137 bets. Also explain how you construct a 95% confidence interval about your estimate of his winnings !-->

We will approach the problem by building a simulation of what Dr.Brownlow has done.First we will simulate the 35 members of his class by ramdomly picking 35 numbers with replacement from the numbers from 1 to 365 which represent the different possible bdays one can have.(We will leave out February 29th for simplicity).
Then we will check to see if any of the chosen numbers match (i.e. people have the same birthday).We will keep the ledger of Brownlows profits or loses for each class. After doing this for 1137 successive classes, we: 
[1] total up Brownlows profits. This will give us one estimate of what Brownlows could have made. For us to make a confidence interval about his earnings we will need to repeat this process several times and then consider all of the repeats. We have learned 68-95 rule that says a good 95% confidence interval could be obatined by taking the average of these seperate attempts and bounding it by 2 standard deviations, above and below the average.

# Confidence interval of Brownlows earning

# Discussion and Conclusion

<!--Discussion and conclusion here.  If professor Brownlow is consistantly making or losing money how could he change his payout so that his profits center on zero?  Also discuss what size his class should be in order to have his current scheme balance at zero profit.!-->
